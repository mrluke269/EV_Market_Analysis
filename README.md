# Analyzing Washington State EV Market Size

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the historical growth and current market penetration of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in Washington State. Leveraging historical EV registration data, we will identify key trends, forecast future market growth, and provide actionable insights for stakeholders involved in EV production, infrastructure planning, and policy formulation.

## Business Context

The increasing adoption of Electric Vehicles presents significant opportunities but also challenges for planning and development. Understanding the EV market size, its growth trajectory, and geographical distribution is crucial for informed decision-making in areas such as charging infrastructure deployment, automotive manufacturing strategies, and government policy incentives.

## Data Source

The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Electric Vehicle Population Size History By County" from [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-size-history-by-county).

## Key Objectives

* Assess the historical growth trend of EV registrations in Washington State.
* Forecast future EV registrations to estimate market growth potential.
* Analyze the distribution of EV registrations across different models, makes, and geographical regions (counties, cities).
* Provide data-driven insights to support stakeholders in decision-making processes.

## Project Structure

* `data/`: Stores raw and processed datasets.
* `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks documenting the analytical workflow.
* `reports/`: Will house final dashboards (Power BI) and strategic insights reports.
* `visualizations/`: Stores individual visualizations, screenshots, and exportable dashboard files.

## Deliverables
